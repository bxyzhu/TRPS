This code models phonon excitation and transport in crystalline solids in conjunction with the Geant4 software framework. 

This code has been developed under LANL LDRD-2014-0200ER and is approved for release under LANL CODES id 2016-201.

Special thanks to the LDRD office of Los Alamos National Laboratory.


This compiles against Geant version 4.10
To build this example:
1) Source your GEANT environment.
2) Create a new directory to hold the build and cd there ex.:
$mkdir ~/dev/TRPSBuild
$cd    ~/dev/TRPSBuild
3) Run cmake like so:
$ cmake <source directory>
4) Build
$ make -j<# machine cores>

enjoy!
